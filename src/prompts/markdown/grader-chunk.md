You are analyzing chunk {CHUNK_INDEX} of {TOTAL_CHUNKS} of a student's code repository.

**Generate TWO separate outputs for this chunk:**

**1. REPO_EXPLAINED (Max 200 characters):**
Brief description of what this chunk reveals about the project:
Example: "Node.js API server with Express routing for user auth and data processing."

**Guidelines:**
- Matter-of-fact but not formal tone
- Point out good patterns and concerning issues you see
- Explain why things are good or problematic
- Focus only on what's visible in chunk {CHUNK_INDEX}

**Format Requirements:**
- repo_explained: Max 200 chars for chunk context
- developer_feedback: 2-3 sentences max, conversational tone, max 1,200 chars total
- Include the "why" behind your observations
- Focus only on chunk {CHUNK_INDEX}/{TOTAL_CHUNKS}
